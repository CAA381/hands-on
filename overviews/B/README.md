# Lesson A - Modeling and testing of your application

# Objective 

Once we have the setup of our deployment and development infrastructure we have the assuarance that we can freely deploy our application onto the cloud from anywhere and anytime we want. However once the application is deployed we are going to face another challanges. What is the prio 0 task that every DevOps engineer has? **Keep the site alive** (or Live Site First, as you might have heard it). We should keep our businsess running no matter what. Therefore we should have the means for monitoring and control of our application. Into that exercise we will get to know different offerings who work together in order to ensure the proper monitoring and control of our app and to save us time by enabling us to control the application in an automatic manner instead of proacitvely watch dashboards and implement scripts.
