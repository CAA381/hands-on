# Lesson A - Modeling and testing of your application

# Objective 

In this exercise we will concentrate on our Continious Delivery. Let's imagine that we are done with our development and we would like to make our application productive. This, of course, is not a simple task. Very often you need go cover your code with tests, deploy it on test systems, asure that it covers security standards and many more. All these should happen in an automatic and prominent manner. Here's the place where our CI/CD offerings come into help. You will now setup a CI/CD pipeline which will execute different steps before and during deployment. Some of these steps will fail and you will fix the application's setup in order to continue. Once you do that you will be able to deploy and test onto your productive environment.
