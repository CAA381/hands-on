# Lesson A - Modeling and testing of your application

#Objective 
In that exercise we will put ourselves into the shoes of a DevOps team member. Our team is new to SAP Cloud Platform and we would like to see how a change is made and also how we can deploy our solution in an easy manner without much effort. Our application is called **bookshop** and it consists of a frontend, backend(written in Node.js) and a database(using SAP HANA).  We have already discovered the convinient CAP model and we have our application converted into CAP. We have our solution submitted into GitHub and we want to start working on it. In this exercse we are going to:

1. Import our existing application in our SAP WebIDE 
2. Introduce a small change into it and test it locally in the browser
3. Convert our application to a Multi-Target Application and deploy it to the cloud
