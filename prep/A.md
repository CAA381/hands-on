# Lesson A - Modeling and Test of your application
# Preparation - Import the application from GitHub to SAP Web IDE

## Objective
Our first objective is to set the stage for this exercise. As mentioned in the [exercise A overview page](../../overviews/A/README.md) our application is already in GitHub, so now we are going to import it and test it into SAP Web IDE and then deploy it manually on SAP Cloud Platform

### What you will learn during this preparation
During this par you will learn how to import an existing application from GitHub to SAP Web IDE.

## Estimated time
10 minutes 

# 1. Explore Project
First, let's have short esxplorataion of our project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/teched-test/testapp-without-mta). As you will most probably notice this is SAP Cloud Application Programming Model based application.

# 2. Access SAP Web IDE and import github project
Let's open the SAP Web IDE. In order to do that simply follow
(this link)[https://webidecp-fiori.dispatcher.sap.hana.ondemand.com/] and **authenticate with the P-user and password provided on your handout materials.**

Once you do this, you will be at the entry page of SAP Web IDE. It is time to clone our github repository into Web IDE. To do so click on **File > Git > Clone Repository**, as shown on the picture below
